## Project management
The project backlog and code is tracked and managed via Azure DevOps and uses the [Agile process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process?view=azure-devops)

It is the responsibility of everyone on the team to update their user stories and tasks before the next project review meeting.
**ALL** tasks need a parent, this should be all the way up to EPIC to ensure they meet the project aims.

## Documentation
Project documentation and comms are handled through Teams / SharePoint.

## Planning meetings
There will be a x2 weekly recurring project review meeting scheduled with an agenda included in the invite. Access the [Project Plan](/Overview/Plan).

## Minutes & decisions
All meeting actions to be captured and recorded by the PM and stored in the [project Wiki](/Overview/Meetings)

## General conversations
General conversation should be carried out through Teams using the '@' handle to notify staff of messages of interest. This will ensure important communication is centrally stored and available.

## Where email is used
Email for communications is fine, however not to track work. Please copy any email to the Azure DevOps backlog to which it refers, @ the person you had in the TO: field and they will be notified that an action is waiting, e.g. any discussions or questions to be had around particular project tasks.
